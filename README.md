The application is where the magic happens.
By pressing the Track Ride button you are connected to a JAVA server which then requests the
location from the FindMyBike Arduino gps.
The server sends back the location to the Android Application and then displays the coordinates
on the google map interface in the application.


Users can also locate their bikes using the systems webpage.
User can login to the systems webpage with their user credentials they receive with the product.


Arduino ADK MEGA
We used the Mega to install our tracking program and process the data from the 3G
